_**Assistant**_

I can see you have an E-Bike Assistant app with React, TypeScript, and Electron. Let me examine the current state of the project to understand what needs to be built or improved. Let me check the main app components to understand the current state: Let me check the components to see what's already implemented: Now I can see the current state of the project. I notice that the app has a good foundation but needs several improvements:

1. The Home page is still using default Vite content instead of proper E-Bike Assistant content
2. The Diagnostics page is incomplete - it should use the Diagnostics component
3. The app needs better styling and structure
4. Missing Parts page from the README description

Let me continue building the app by improving these areas: 
```

```
Now let me update the Diagnostics page to use the proper Diagnostics component: 
```

```
Let me check the FaultSelector and SolutionSteps components to see if they need improvement: Now let me improve these components with better styling: 
```

```

```

```

```

```
Now let me create a dedicated Parts page since it's mentioned in the README: Let me check what's in the existing Parts.tsx file: 
```

```
Now I need to update the PartItem component to support the enhanced part data: 
```

```
Now let me update the `App.tsx` to include the Parts route: 
```

```
Now let me create a proper Header component: 
```

```
Now let me improve the About page: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.

Let me now enhance the diagnostics logic with more comprehensive fault information: Let me check the current diagnostics file: I see the diagnostics file has already been enhanced. Let me run the development server to test the current state of the app: Let me check the terminal output: It seems like vite isn't installed. Let me install the dependencies: Let me check if there are any issues with the installation: Let me create a simple maintenance tracking component to add to the app: Now let me create a new Maintenance page: Let me add the Maintenance route to the App.tsx: 
```

```
Now let me update the Header to include the Maintenance link: 
```

```

```

```
Now let me add a maintenance link to the Home page: 
```

```
Let me also create a simple Tips & Guides component to add more value to the app: Now let me create a Guides page: Let me add the Guides route to the app: 
```

```
Let me update the Header to include Guides in navigation: 
```

```
Now let me add a fourth feature card for Guides on the home page: 
```

```
Let me also update the mobile navigation to include Guides: 
```

```
Now let me try to run the development server again to test our progress: Let me check that the dependencies are properly installed and run the dev server: Let me try a simple build command to check if everything compiles correctly: Let me create a simple PWA manifest and service worker to complete the PWA setup: Great! The PWA manifest is already set up. Let me also check if we have a proper vite configuration: Copilot has been working on this problem for a while. It can continue to iterate, or you can send a new message to refine your prompt.
