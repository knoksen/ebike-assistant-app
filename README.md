## üíæ Technical Details

### Core Features

- Works offline after first install
- Automatic updates
- No account needed
- Secure: all data stays on your phone
- Low battery usage

### üì° Bluetooth Connectivity

The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) with GATT services to communicate with e-bikes:

#### Architecture Notes

1. **Transport Abstraction**
   - Supports both encrypted (FE95) and plain (NUS) protocols
   - Pluggable crypto implementation for secure sessions
   - Device-specific adapters handle protocol variations

2. **Security Implementation**
   - ECDH-based handshake for Xiaomi devices
   - Secure session management via `XiaomiECDH`
   - Cryptographic operations isolated in `NinebotSecureCryptor`

3. **Firmware Operations**
   - Firmware flashing capabilities are isolated
   - Not included in v1 release
   - When implemented:
     - Requires explicit user consent
     - Mandatory checksum verification
     - Extensive error handling

#### Supported Protocols

1. **Xiaomi/Mi Protocol**
   - Service UUID: `0000fe95-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
   - Secure authentication via ECDH
   - Encrypted telemetry and commands
   - Some devices only expose FE95 with encrypted commands

2. **Nordic UART Service (NUS)**
   - Service UUID: `6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e`
   - TX Characteristic: `6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e`
   - RX Characteristic: `6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e`
   - Simple UART-style communication
   - Used by some models for direct communication

#### Device Compatibility

- Models vary in their protocol support
- Some use only encrypted FE95 service
- Others use simpler UART-style interface
- Transport layer abstracts these differences

#### Telemetry Capabilities

- Battery metrics:
  - Individual cell voltages (1-10 cells)
  - Pack voltage and current
  - State of charge
  - Temperature monitoring
  - External battery support

- Vehicle data:
  - Error code reporting
  - Total mileage tracking
  - Speed and performance metrics
  - BMS/ESC diagnostics

#### Control Features

- Cruise control management
- Riding mode presets
- Security settings
- Performance tuning

### üîí Security

- ECDH-based authentication
- Session encryption
- Secure parameter validation
- Rate-limited commands
- See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details

## üñ•Ô∏è Desktop & Distribution

For power users, we also offer a desktop version with additional features. See [desktop installation guide](DESKTOP.md).

## üöÄ Release Preparation

Run the full quality gate:

```bash
npm run prep:release
```

If everything passes, create a tag and build platform packages:

```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "v1.0.0" && git push --tags
npm run electron:dist
```

Optional platform targets:

```bash
npm run electron:win
npm run electron:mac
npm run electron:linux
```

### üìì Changelog & Highlights

See the full [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for complete details. v1.0.0 highlights:

- Core modules: Boost profiles, Diagnostics assistant, Maintenance tracker, Parts & Ride views
- Unified Bluetooth connect lifecycle + transport abstraction groundwork
- PWA installable + offline + auto-update
- Electron desktop packaging (Windows installers & portable build)
- Shared progress bar + screenshot automation workflow


### Manual Smoke Checklist

- [ ] App loads over HTTPS (PWA install prompt shows)
- [ ] Connect button scans & handles cancel gracefully
- [ ] Boost profile save / load works after refresh
- [ ] Dark / Light mode persists
- [ ] Navigation works on mobile (dock) & desktop (header)
- [ ] No console errors in production build

### Environment & Logging

Runtime behavior is controlled with Vite env vars (all prefixed with `VITE_`). Create a `.env.local` for overrides during development.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `VITE_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` (dev) / `warn` (prod via `.env.production`) | Controls verbosity of custom logger (`error` `warn` `info` `debug`). |
| `VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS` | `false` | Future hook for optional telemetry (not yet implemented). |

Production build automatically picks up `.env.production` which sets `VITE_LOG_LEVEL=warn` to reduce noise. Adjust per deployment if deeper diagnostics are needed.


### Generating Screenshots

Use Playwright automation or manual capture for consistent assets. See the full [Screenshot Guide](docs/SCREENSHOTS.md).

#### Automated (Playwright)

Install once and capture:

```bash
npm i -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
npm run build
npm run screenshots
```

PNG outputs land in `docs/screenshots/` (home, diagnostics, boost, maintenance, parts, rides, settings).

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

For developer documentation and contribution guidelines, see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

## üßπ Housekeeping / Future

Planned improvements:

- Real battery & error telemetry parsing refinements
- Firmware flashing workflow (guarded, post-1.0)
- Cloud sync (optional) with end‚Äëto‚Äëend encryption
- Localization pipeline
