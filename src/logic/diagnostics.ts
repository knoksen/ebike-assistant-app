      'Verify the charger is properly connected to both the wall outlet and the battery charging port',
      'Check that the charger LED indicator is functioning - it should show a red or orange light when connected',
      'Inspect the battery charging port and charger connector for any debris, corrosion, or physical damage',

      'Verify the display unit is powered on and showing normal readings',
      'Test that brake sensors are not preventing motor operation - lift rear wheel and spin pedals gently',
      'Inspect all visible wiring connections for looseness, damage, or corrosion',
      'Check the pedal assist sensor (PAS) for proper alignment and cleanliness',
      'Verify the throttle (if equipped) is not stuck or damaged',

    category: 'performance',
    severity: 'medium',
    estimatedTime: '15-30 minutes',
    steps: [
      'Check the battery charge level and ensure it reaches 100% when fully charged',
      'Verify tire pressure is within the recommended range (check tire sidewall)',
      'Inspect tires for excessive wear or damage that could increase rolling resistance',
      'Ensure the chain is properly lubricated and not dragging or skipping',
      'Check brake pads are not dragging against the rotors or rims',
      'Consider riding conditions - hills, headwinds, and cold weather reduce range',
      'Review your riding style - higher assist levels and speeds consume more battery',
      'Check if the battery is several years old - lithium batteries naturally degrade over time'

    severity: 'medium',
    estimatedTime: '20-35 minutes',
    steps: [
      'Identify when the noise occurs - during acceleration, constant speed, or when pedaling',
      'Check if the noise is coming from the motor, chain, or other drivetrain components',
      'Inspect the chain for proper lubrication, tension, and wear',
      'Examine the motor mounting bolts for tightness and proper torque',
      'Look for any debris or foreign objects caught in the motor housing or spokes',
      'Check derailleur adjustment and shifting quality if noise occurs during gear changes',
      'Listen carefully to distinguish between mechanical and electrical motor sounds',
      'Document the specific type of noise (grinding, clicking, whining) for professional diagnosis if needed'

    steps: [
      'Verify you are using the original charger or a manufacturer-approved replacement',
      'Check the charger output specifications match the battery requirements',
      'Ensure the charging environment temperature is within normal range (50-80Â°F)',
      'Inspect charger and battery contacts for cleanliness and good connection',
      'Try charging at a different time of day to rule out electrical supply issues',
      'Monitor the charging process - some batteries charge faster initially and slower as they near full capacity',
      'Consider battery age - older batteries naturally charge more slowly and hold less capacity'
